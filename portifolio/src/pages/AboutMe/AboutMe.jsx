          I was first introduced to computing as an undergraduate. I was amazed
          by their logic, functions, and the manipulation and understanding of
          data. I quickly realized how powerful Microsoft is and took it upon
          myself to understand and learn Microsoft Excel; from there, I built
          different macros to help automate simple tasks at work using VBA and
          macros. I soon realized that there is a whole world of programming
          languages. For the past two years, I have been learning new
          programming languages via udemy.com. Learning Java, HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript has developed into a personal hobby and now a full time
          career i'm currently a junior developer at TEKSystems Global
