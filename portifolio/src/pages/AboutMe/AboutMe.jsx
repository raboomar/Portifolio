          I was first introduced to computing as an undergraduate. I was amazed
          by the logic, functions, and ability to manipulate and understand
          data. I quickly realized how powerful Microsoft is and took it upon
          myself to understand and learn Microsoft Excel; from there, I built
          different macros to help automate simple tasks at work using VBA and
          macros. I soon realized that there is a whole world of programming
          languages. For the past two years, I have been learning new
          programming languages via udemy.com. Learning Java, HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript has developed into a personal hobby and is now a full-time
          career. I'm a junior developer at TEKSystems Global using Java,
          JavaScript and React to help clients achieve their goals by building
          solutions to thrive in a new world of opportunities.
